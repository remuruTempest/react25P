Let's break down this code in simple terms. We have two separate files here: one that uses a custom hook (`useLocalStorage`) to manage light/dark mode, and another that defines the custom hook itself. I'll explain each part step by step.

### 1. **LightDarkMode Component (`LightDarkMode.js`)**

This is the main file where the logic for switching between light and dark modes happens.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import useLocalStorage from './useLocalStorage';  // Import the custom hook
import './theme.css';  // Import the CSS for themes (styling)

export default function LightDarkMode() { 
    // The `useLocalStorage` hook is used to manage the theme in local storage
    const [theme, setTheme] = useLocalStorage("theme", "dark");  
    
    // This function changes the theme when the button is clicked
    function haddleToggleTheme() {
        setTheme(theme === "light" ? "dark" : "light");  // Toggle between light and dark themes
    }

    console.log(theme);  // This will log the current theme (either "light" or "dark")

    return (
        <div className="light-dark-mode" data-theme={theme}>
            <div className="container">
                <p>Hello World!</p>
                <button onClick={haddleToggleTheme}>
                    Change theme
                </button>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

### What is happening here?

- **useLocalStorage("theme", "dark")**: This is a custom hook that helps store and retrieve the theme (either "light" or "dark") from the browser’s `localStorage`. If the user has previously chosen a theme, it will use that. Otherwise, it defaults to "dark".
  
- **haddleToggleTheme**: This is a function that toggles the theme between "light" and "dark". When the button is clicked, it checks the current theme:
  - If it is "light", it switches to "dark".
  - If it is "dark", it switches to "light".

- **<button onClick={haddleToggleTheme}>**: When this button is clicked, the `haddleToggleTheme` function is triggered, changing the theme.

- **data-theme={theme}**: This sets a custom attribute (`data-theme`) on the main `<div>` element. The value of this attribute is either "light" or "dark" depending on the current theme. This is useful for applying different CSS styles based on the theme.

### 2. **useLocalStorage Custom Hook (`useLocalStorage.js`)**

This file defines the custom hook `useLocalStorage`. A hook in React is a special function that lets you "hook into" React features, like managing state or side effects.

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export default function useLocalStorage(key, defaultValue) {
    const [value, setValue] = useState(() => {
        let currentValue;

        try {
            // Try to get the value from localStorage and parse it as JSON
            currentValue = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || String(defaultValue));
        } catch (error) {
            console.log(error);
            currentValue = defaultValue;  // If there's an error, use the default value
        }
        return currentValue;
    });
    
    useEffect(() => {
        // Whenever the `value` changes, update localStorage
        localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    }, [key, value]);  // This effect runs when either `key` or `value` changes

    return [value, setValue];
}
```

### What is happening here?

- **useState**: This hook is used to create a piece of state (`value`) that will hold the current theme. It’s initialized with a function that:
  - Tries to get the value from `localStorage` using the provided `key` (in this case, "theme").
  - If there’s an error (like the user’s browser doesn’t support `localStorage`), it defaults to the `defaultValue` (either "dark" or "light").
  
- **useEffect**: This hook runs when the component first renders and also whenever the `value` changes. It updates the `localStorage` to store the new theme (`value`) so that it persists even if the page is reloaded.
  
- **return [value, setValue]**: This returns both the current theme (`value`) and the function (`setValue`) to update it. This is similar to how React’s `useState` works.

### How It All Works Together:

1. **Theme Management**: When the `LightDarkMode` component renders, it uses the `useLocalStorage` hook to get the current theme from `localStorage`. If no theme is found, it defaults to "dark".
   
2. **Toggling Theme**: When the user clicks the "Change theme" button, it calls `haddleToggleTheme`, which toggles the theme between "light" and "dark" and updates the `localStorage` using `setTheme`.

3. **Persistence**: The theme is stored in `localStorage` (via the `useLocalStorage` hook). This means that even if the user refreshes the page, the theme they selected will remain.

4. **CSS Styling**: The `data-theme={theme}` attribute on the `<div>` element allows CSS to change the styles based on the theme. For example, you might have different background colors or text colors for light and dark modes.

### To Summarize:

- This code helps you create a toggle for switching between light and dark modes in a web application.
- It saves the user's preference in the browser’s `localStorage`, so the theme persists even after a page reload.
- The custom hook `useLocalStorage` makes it easy to manage this stored data.
