Certainly! Let's break down this code more thoroughly, in a way that's beginner-friendly, so you can understand each part step by step.

### 1. **React and State Setup**

First, we need to know that this code is written in **React**, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for building **dynamic websites** or **single-page applications (SPAs)**.

In React, we often use **state** to manage the information that can change over time and that needs to be reflected in the user interface (UI). The state is stored in variables, and when state changes, React automatically updates the displayed content.

### 2. **Imports**

```javascript
import React from "react";
import data from "./data";
import { useState } from "react";
import "./styles.css";
```

- **React**: React is the core library for building the UI.
- **data**: This is the imported data that contains the questions and answers that will be displayed in the accordion. It's expected to be an array of objects (we’ll look at the structure in a moment).
- **useState**: This is a React hook used to manage state in functional components.
- **"./styles.css"**: This is the CSS file for styling the components. It controls the look and feel of the accordion.

### 3. **Component Function**

```javascript
export default function Accordian() {
```

- This is the **main function** of your React component. The function is named `Accordian`, and it will be used to render the UI for the accordion.

### 4. **State Variables**

```javascript
const [selected, setSelected] = useState(null);
const [enableMultiSelection, setEnableMultiSelection] = useState(false);
const [multiple, setMultiple] = useState([]);
```

- **selected**: This keeps track of the currently selected item’s ID (in single selection mode). Initially, it's set to `null` (meaning no item is selected).
- **enableMultiSelection**: This controls whether **multiple selections** are allowed. It starts as `false`, meaning only **one item can be selected** at a time. If you click the button to enable multi-selection, it will change to `true`.
- **multiple**: This stores the list of selected item IDs when multi-selection mode is enabled. Initially, it’s an empty array `[]`, meaning no items are selected.

### 5. **Handling Single Selection**

```javascript
function handleSingleSelection(getCurrentId) {
    setSelected(getCurrentId === selected ? null : getCurrentId);
}
```

- **handleSingleSelection** is a function that handles selecting or deselecting an item in **single selection mode** (when `enableMultiSelection` is `false`).
- When you click on an item:
  - It checks if the item is already selected by comparing its ID (`getCurrentId`) to the `selected` state.
  - If it **is selected**, it **deselects** it by setting `selected` to `null`.
  - If it **isn’t selected**, it **selects** it by setting `selected` to the ID of the clicked item.

### 6. **Handling Multi Selection**

```javascript
function handleMultiSelection(getCurrentId) {
    let cpyMltiple = [...multiple]; 
    const findIndexOfCurrentId = cpyMltiple.indexOf(getCurrentId);

    if (findIndexOfCurrentId === -1) {
        cpyMltiple.push(getCurrentId);
    } else {
        cpyMltiple.splice(findIndexOfCurrentId, 1);
    }

    setMultiple(cpyMltiple);
}
```

- **handleMultiSelection** is a function that handles selecting or deselecting an item in **multi-selection mode** (when `enableMultiSelection` is `true`).
- When you click on an item:
  - It creates a **copy** of the `multiple` array (using `let cpyMltiple = [...multiple];`).
  - It checks if the clicked item’s ID (`getCurrentId`) is already in the `multiple` array.
    - If the ID **isn’t** in the array (i.e., it's a new selection), it adds the ID to the array with `push()`.
    - If the ID **is already** in the array (i.e., you want to deselect it), it removes the ID using `splice()`.
  - Finally, it updates the `multiple` state with the new `cpyMltiple` array.

### 7. **Logging for Debugging**

```javascript
console.log(selected, multiple);
```

- This line simply prints the current values of `selected` and `multiple` to the browser’s console every time the component is re-rendered. This helps with debugging, so you can see what the state is doing.

### 8. **JSX (The Rendered UI)**

Now we come to the **rendering** part, where React displays the actual content in the browser. It uses JSX, a syntax that looks like HTML, but is actually JavaScript.

```javascript
return (
    <div className="wrapper">
        <button onClick={() => setEnableMultiSelection(!enableMultiSelection)}>
            Enable multi Selection
        </button>
        <div className="accordian">
            {data && data.length > 0 ? (
                data.map((dataItem) => (
                    <div className="item">
                        <div
                            onClick={
                                enableMultiSelection
                                    ? () => handleMultiSelection(dataItem.id)
                                    : () => handleSingleSelection(dataItem.id)
                            }
                            className="title"
                        >
                            <h3>{dataItem.question}</h3>
                            <span>+</span>
                            <div>
                                {enableMultiSelection
                                    ? multiple.indexOf(dataItem.id) !== -1 && (
                                          <div className="content">{dataItem.answer}</div>
                                      )
                                    : selected === dataItem.id && (
                                          <div className="content">{dataItem.answer}</div>
                                      )}
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                ))
            ) : (
                <div> No data found!</div>
            )}
        </div>
    </div>
);
```

#### Detailed Explanation:

- **Toggle Multi-Selection Button**:
  - The button toggles the `enableMultiSelection` state between `true` and `false` when clicked.
  - When `enableMultiSelection` is `true`, users can select multiple items; when it's `false`, only one item can be selected.
  
- **Rendering the Accordion Items**:
  - `data.map((dataItem) => ...)`: This loops over each item in the `data` array and renders the items in the UI.
  - Each item has a `question` (the question text) and an `answer` (the answer to the question).

- **Selecting Items**:
  - If **multi-selection** is enabled (`enableMultiSelection === true`), clicking on a question calls `handleMultiSelection`, and the answer is shown if the item is selected.
  - If **single selection** is enabled (`enableMultiSelection === false`), clicking on a question calls `handleSingleSelection`, and the answer is shown if the item is selected.

- **No Data**: If there is no data (`data.length === 0`), it will show "No data found!".

### 9. **Styling**

- The CSS file (`styles.css`) controls how the accordion looks. For example, the `.title` might be styled as a clickable title, and `.content` might be hidden until an item is selected.

---

### 10. **Summary**:

- This code creates an **accordion** where each question can show or hide its corresponding answer.
- It has two modes:
  - **Single selection**: Only one item can be selected at a time, and when an item is clicked, its answer appears.
  - **Multi-selection**: Multiple items can be selected, and their answers will appear when clicked.
- The state is managed using React's `useState` hook, and the component re-renders whenever the state changes.
- The accordion items are dynamically created from the `data` array.
