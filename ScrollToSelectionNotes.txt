### **2. `ScrollToSection` Component**

This component allows scrolling to a specific section (or card) based on user interaction, where each section is styled differently.

#### **a. Static Data**
The `data` array contains objects with a label and style for each card. Each item in this array is used to generate a section (card) with a specific background color and height.

- **Example**:
  ```js
  const data = [
    { label: "First Card", style: { width: "100%", height: "600px", background: "red" } },
    { label: "Second Card", style: { width: "100%", height: "600px", background: "grey" } },
    // Other cards...
  ];
  ```

#### **b. Scroll to Section Function**
The `handleScrollToSection` function is used to scroll to a specific card (the third one, in this case).

- **How it works**:
  - `ref.current.getBoundingClientRect().top`: This calculates the position of the target element relative to the viewport.
  - `window.scrollTo`: This is then used to scroll the page smoothly to that position.

  ```js
  function handleScrollToSection() {
    let pos = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect().top;
    window.scrollTo({
      top: pos,
      behavior: "smooth",
    });
  }
  ```

#### **c. Using `ref` for the Target Section**
In this component, only the third card (`index === 2`) gets a reference (`ref`), which allows the page to scroll to that specific card when the button is clicked.

- **Example**:
  ```js
  {data.map((dataItem, index) => (
    <div ref={index === 2 ? ref : null} style={dataItem.style}>
      <h3>{dataItem.label}</h3>
    </div>
  ))}
  ```
  - The third item (with `index === 2`) will be the target for the scroll.

#### **d. Button to Scroll**
When the "Click To Scroll" button is clicked, the page will scroll to the third card (`ref` is assigned to it). The button calls `handleScrollToSection` to perform this scroll action.

### **Key Concepts Recap:**

1. **`useRef`**: Keeps a reference to a DOM element that doesn't trigger re-renders. It's great for direct DOM manipulation like scrolling.
   
2. **`useFetch`**: This is a custom hook to fetch data asynchronously. It helps manage the fetch lifecycle (pending, data, and errors).
   
3. **Smooth Scrolling**: Achieved through `window.scrollTo()` and `scrollIntoView()` with the `behavior: "smooth"` option. This ensures a user-friendly scroll transition.

4. **Event Handlers**: The buttons' `onClick` events are used to trigger scroll functions.

5. **Conditional Rendering**: The `ref` for the third card is conditionally set based on the `index` value. This enables you to scroll to specific sections.

---

### **Example Workflow (In Both Components):**

1. **In `ScrollToTopAndBottom`:**
   - When you click "Scroll To Bottom," the page smoothly scrolls to the section marked with `bottomRef`.
   - When you click "Scroll To Top," the page scrolls back to the top.

2. **In `ScrollToSection`:**
   - When you click the button, the page scrolls smoothly to the third card, which has a blue background.

### **2. `ScrollToSection` Component**

This component allows the user to scroll to a specific section (card) on the page when a button is clicked.

#### **State Setup and Data Structure:**
```js
const data = [
  { label: "First Card", style: { width: "100%", height: "600px", background: "red" } },
  { label: "Second Card", style: { width: "100%", height: "600px", background: "grey" } },
  { label: "Third Card", style: { width: "100%", height: "600px", background: "blue" } },
  { label: "Fourth Card", style: { width: "100%", height: "600px", background: "green" } },
  { label: "Fifth Card", style: { width: "100%", height: "600px", background: "orange" } },
];
```
- `data` is an array of objects, each representing a "card" with a label and some styles (color and height).
  
#### **Scroll to Section Function:**
```js
function handleScrollToSection() {
  let pos = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect().top;
  window.scrollTo({
    top: pos,
    behavior: "smooth",
  });
}
```
- This function scrolls the page to a specific section using `ref`. The `getBoundingClientRect().top` method gets the distance of the section from the top of the viewport.
- `window.scrollTo` is then used to scroll the page smoothly to that position.

#### **Rendering:**
```js
return (
  <div>
    <h1>Scroll to a particular section</h1>
    <button onClick={handleScrollToSection}>Click To Scroll</button>
    {data.map((dataItem, index) => (
      <div ref={index === 2 ? ref : null} style={dataItem.style}>
        <h3>{dataItem.label}</h3>
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```
- **Button**: When the button is clicked, the page will scroll to the third card (because the `ref` is set to the third item in the `data` array).
- **Mapping Data**: It maps over the `data` array to create a card for each item. Only the third card gets the `ref` attached (`index === 2 ? ref : null`).

#### **Example Workflow:**
- When the page loads, you'll see 5 cards with different background colors.
- Clicking the button will scroll the page to the third card, because the `ref` is assigned to it.

---

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**
- **`useRef` Hook**: This is used to reference DOM elements directly and access their properties or methods (like `scrollIntoView` or `getBoundingClientRect`).
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Both components use `window.scrollTo` or `scrollIntoView` with the `behavior: 'smooth'` option to enable smooth scrolling.
- **Conditional Rendering**: You conditionally render loading and error states (`pending` and `error`) based on the result of the data fetch.
- **Event Handling**: The button's `onClick` event triggers functions that perform actions like scrolling.

---

### **Visual Example:**

1. **In `ScrollToTopAndBottom`:**
   - If you click "Scroll To Bottom," the page scrolls down to the bottom section.
   - If you click "Scroll To Top," the page scrolls back to the top.

2. **In `ScrollToSection`:**
   - The button scrolls the page to the third card, which has a blue background.
